# MNIST_memristor
Python code implementing the algorithms of my MSc Dissertation on "Modified training for increased robustness in memristor-based neural networks".

The purpose of the project was to investigate a hardware accelerator for Deep Learning based on the use of a novel electronic device called memristor. 
These devices arranged in crossbar arrays directly implement the conceptual structure of artificial neural networks. Due to this similarity,
memristor-based artificial neural networks are expected to perform more rapidly and with a lower energetic cost that the present implementetions
in digital general-purpose computing devices.
